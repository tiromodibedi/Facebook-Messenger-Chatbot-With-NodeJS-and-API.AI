## Facebook Messenger Chatbot With NodeJS and API.AI
* A Chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. [wikipedia]
* Facebook allows developers to create Chatbots for many different
use cases such as: marketing, hospitality, e-commerce e.t.c . These Chatbots are
exposed to users through Facebook Messenger.

## How to make a simple Chatbot?
* Most Technophiles like myself couldn't escape the Chatbot wave that is slowly
taking over the tech industry. So this is what I have learnt on my journey to a
build my own A.I personal Assistant.

## The TECHNOLOGY STACK
* NodeJS - An open source server framework. We need to create a server application with the ability to process requests and fire back responses.
* Facebook Messenger Developer Plartform - We are going to hook up our server to
facebook messenger so that it will listen to message requests coming in from
facebook messenger and provide relevant responses.
* API.AI - This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine by Google which levarages the power of AI that will give our Chatbot the ability to understand
Natural Language. So the Chatbot will be able to engage in a small-talk conversation.
* Weather API - On top of small-talk conversation our Chatbot will be able to tell us the weather in any city at any time so we need to hook it up to a weather API service so that it will have access to real-time weather data.
* Heroku - This a service we are going to use to deploy our Chatbot in the cloud and tie everything together.
